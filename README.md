# What does this app do?

As a member of the 395th Army Band we meet once a month and two weeks over the summer. There is always a month gap between periods where we meet where information and schedules can be forgotten and/or lost. We use Microsoft Teams, but the commonly accessed information can get lost in the pile of messages. Newer Soldiers also seem to have a hard time getting the "lay of the land" and I have always wanted to have an app that can be a quick references for common documents as well as a place where Soldiers can look for answers to their questions instead of asking their leaders who could be busy with their civilian jobs.
